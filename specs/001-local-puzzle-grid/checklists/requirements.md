# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Puzzle Grid Architecture

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: November 8, 2025
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification has been updated to be fully technology-agnostic
- UI library clarification has been resolved (Option C: Allow any UI library that helps with grid rendering)
- All requirements are now implementation-neutral while maintaining clear intent
- Ready to proceed to planning phase
